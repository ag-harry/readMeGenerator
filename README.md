## Technical Details
This application operates on Node.js and leverages the Inquirer package for a user-friendly command-line interface. The application's primary logic is contained within the generateMarkdown function, which takes user responses as input and generates a detailed and structured README file, encapsulating all critical project details.

The command node index.js initiates the application, leading to a series of project-related prompts for the user. The generateMarkdown function utilizes the user's responses to create the README markdown text, which is then written to a README.md file within the project's main directory.

This application accelerates the project creation process, eradicating the need for manual README composition and ensuring the production of thorough, professional, and consistent documentation.
